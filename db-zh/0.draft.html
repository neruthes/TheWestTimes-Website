<p>Over the recent years, with weaker economic growth, China is still overall successful during its rise, or "The Great Renaissance". Some voices praise the efficiency of China, and some among them imply that the inefficiency roots in the multi-party electoral systems. It is extremely dangerous to our democracy if the rumors continue to devastate the faith in democracy; we the people of the West should not let a few years of achievements charm our eyes.</p>

<p>Through careful investigation, we have concluded in this article that the efficiency of a government has no absolute causal relationship with whether the electoral system is a socialist one-party system or capitalist multi-party system. It is groundless to pretend as if there is any such relationship; the argument is supported by neither historical experience nor theoretical study.</p>

<h3>The Myth of Efficiency</h3>

<p>"Governance is not only about democracy," some famous pro-China economists (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_China_Rules_the_World" target="_blank">Martin Jacques</a>) always tell us. However, the same should apply to efficiency as well — governance is not only about efficiency.</p>

<h3>A History of Inefficiency in Modern China</h3>

<p>Inefficiency is a common phenomenon, rather than a feature of the West. It can happen in the United States, in Europe, in Africa; it can also happen in China. Envisioning China as a place of unmatchable efficiency and zero corruption is only a fantasy, but unfortunately, the fantasy has been adopted by a lot of people.</p>

<h3>Modernization with Western Characteristics</h3>

<p>As we gradually shift into a world which is becoming more China-led and less West-led, as we gradually get used to living with the new circumstances, a mission remains important — to retain our western identity and western heritage as we keep modernizing. Some predicted that, as we continue to modernize, we will inevitably easternize, as same as China and Japan did westernize, more or less, during their initial modernization.</p>

<p>But what we must understand is that China and Japan did not comprehensively westernize; they unarguably retained their eastern identity and eastern heritages, although they did relinquish a lot of eastern traditions meanwhile. Westerners are no inferior to the Chinese; if they can retain their eastern identity, so can we.</p>

<p>We the westerners must choose our paths wisely. Eastern "cosmopolitan ideas" must be evaluated with caution, and eastern "successful policies" must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis before adoption. CPC itself endured the bitter of taking foreign instructions without combining with their local reality during its initial expansion before World War Ⅱ; if we are to learn from China, we should learn this part first.</p>

<p>We should follow neither the Antique Path of Imperialism nor the Chinese Path of Socialism; instead, we will have to find the possibilities for the future from <em>our own history</em> and must explore <em>our own path forward</em>. We should often learn from China, but we must always be ourselves.</p>
