<p>During the monumental parades, the peasants, workers, artists, journalists, policemen, and national guards expressed their grief and solidarity for Mr George Floyd. They demonstrated their willingness to convert sorrow into power in order to Make America Great Again.</p>

<p>Also, there have been abnormal phenomena in the meantime. A few extremists spread fake news and attached American values and democracy, summoned people to surround the White House, and some even threatened to end capitalism with communist slogans. In Minnesota and New York, thugs appeared and looted shops and burned the streets.</p>

<p>In best regards to the sadness in the hearts of American people, the Federal Government and the States remained tolerent when emotionally-driven inappropriate activities carried out. Thanks to the mutual effort, the monumental parades across America proceeded in solemnty and polity.</p>

<p>However, after the monumental parades, a few extremists took advantage of the grief for Mr George Floyd to spread fake news for defaming the Federal Government. They openly burned United States flags, violated the Constitution, and slandered American democracy. They incorported illegal organizations in factories and coupped labor unions. They mobilized students and professors to be on strike. They stole the name of labor unions to spread anti-American propaganda and worked on creating even greater riots.</p>

<p>These facts have proven that these few extremists were not practicing monumental parades, not promoting racial equality, and not even merely badmouthing the social status quo. They waved the flag of democracy to destroy democracy; the purpose is to disorient the people and the States into chaos. This is a conspiracy, a riot; its essense is to eliminate the foundation of this city upon the hill. This is a coup in front of the Congress of the American people, a serious political storm.</p>

<p>If the riot is allowed to grow, the entire American society will be in dire chaos. The dreams for pandamic control, infrastructure development, price control, and eliminating police brutality will all be in vain. The progresses since the end of Cold War 1 can be lost, and the vision for MAGA would be in danger. An America of dreams could become an America of riots.</p>

<p>The Congress and the American people must fully understand the seriousnes of this political storm. We must unite under the clear banner that riots must be stopped. The social solidarity must be preserved. The Constitution must be respected. Law and order must be maintained. Illegal organizations shall be dismissed; appropriation over labor unions shall be stopped; illegal parades shall be suspended; looting and burning shall be penalized. American people wholeheatedly wish to eliminate police brutality and to promote racial equality, and they are also the wishes of the Congress and the States. These wishes can only be fulfilled under the leadership of the Federal Government by promoting reforms and reinforcing capitalist democracy.</p>

<p>Congressmen and American People must clearly acknowledge that our nation will be in eternal chaos if the riots are not ended. This struggle is a precondition of MAGA, and is a premise of the future of the nation. Republicans, Democrats, democratic patriots, and American people should know the best and take actions to end the riots immediately!</p>
