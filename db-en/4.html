	Now it is officially a global pandemic.
	WHO on Wednesday declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic, noting that the number of cases outside China had exploded 13-fold over the past 2 weeks.
	Currently, there are more than 118000 cases of COVID-19 in 114 countries, with 4291 deaths, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

<h3>Help for Italy, Applause for UK</h3>

<p>
	Wang Yi, the foreign minister of China talked to Italy on the phone and offered to assist Italy by aiding and exporting medical supplies, despite various racist actions in Italy against Chinese citizens and people of other nationalities.
	However, on the same day, Wang Yi talked to UK on the phone as well, and applauded the healthcare capability of UK and said that he believed that UK could manage it.
	This comparison is more than interesting.
</p>
<p>
	China is known for its global leadership and ubiquitous humanitarianism.
	Probably China can save Italy, but China will not save Europe as a whole.
	There can be many reasons why China found UK less worthy to assist, and it is suspected that the major reason is that Italy is a member state of Belt & Road Initiative.
</p>
<p>
	Has UK been offending China in some ways recently?
	The answer may be no.
	UK messed in South Sea disputes in 2018, but it was like 2 years ago.
	On the contrary, despite US pressures, UK government insisted that Huawei should not be excluded from the 5G construction projects in UK.
</p>
<p>
	One can imagine how China will respond to a request from the Danish government.
</p>
<p>
	If a country needs this last-resort emergency humanitarian assistance, it can try hosting as many Chinese citizens as possible.
	Jokes aside, the preferential assistance from China can involve many factors.
</p>

<h3>No Strings Attached?</h3>

<p>
	It will be naive to think that the assistance from China will not come with political conditions, expressed or implied.
</p>
<p>
	Throughout the African policy of China, as part of BRI, it is specifically emphasized that China only seek business cooperations with no political strings attached.
	Why do they mention this?
	Because previous aiders from the developed countries particularly pursued political conditions in exchange, including government reform and foreign direct access to natural resources.
	The policy experts in China are neither ignorant nor sympathetic.
	China offers a business-is-business posture to African countries because African countries can choose foreign investors.
	Now European countries have no alternative sources of assistance when UK, the country which always claims to have the best healthcare system in the world, is preparing to accept uncontained pandemic as a way to establish common immunity.
	Another Marshall Plan?
	No kidding; the United States cannot even produce enough test cases for domestic consumption, and this is an America-First administration.
</p>
<p>
	It is critical to understand that, although European countries which cannot fulfill their domestic epidemic control requirements can only obtain assistance from China, but China is not as kind as it always appears to be.
	They are looking for paybacks beyond money.
</p>
<p>
	If a country lacks Chinese diaspora communities, does not align much to China diplomatically, has no commercial port to lease to China for 99 or more years, and cannot play an active role in RMB internationalization, why will China bother to assist this particular country when there are other countries like North Korea and Pakistan which host special national interests?
	China is a responsible country but not a generous country; China has to be selective.
	There is an idiom in China, "neither does the landlord has extra corps".
	China may have the greatest productivity of epidemic control supplies, now reaching 200 million masks per day, but it certainly cannot cover the needs of every country.
</p>

<h3>European Policy of China</h3>

<p>
	Geopolitically speaking, the European policy of China may be basically summarized as follows: glue and help; divide and rule.
</p>
<p>
	China does not intend to disintegrate EU since it wants a powerful peer to balance US and Russia, but neither does it want to see a united Europe as powerful as China itself is.
	The best place is where everyone else is an enemy of each other but they are all friends of you.
	The demand for dividing exists not only inside Europe, but also among US, Europe, and Russia.
	If Europe is too weak, China helps to glue it up; if Europe is too strong, China makes interference in the regional affairs and wait for European countries to dislike each other.
</p>
<p>
	In the upcoming decades, China will be increasingly interested in establishing a paramilitary presence in Europe to safeguard its Maritime Silk Road security as part of its Euro-Indian strategy (a funny name indeed), regardless of whether it may admit or not.
</p>

<h3>Switzerland and Ambitions of China</h3>

<p>
	Recently, there have been conflicts among European countries.
	Both Deutschland and Italy have been claimed to have intercepted medical supplies which should legally belong to Switzerland.
	Switzerland is not an EU member state, therefore Switzerland could not expect assistance from EU at the level of intra-EU assistances, which for sure may hardly exist.
</p>
<p>
	Some might ignore how sensitive these developments may be seen in the eyes of the Swiss people.
	Switzerland is a small country in the middle of the three core members of EU, namely, France, Deutschland, and Italy.
	All of them could intercept medical supplies which Switzerland imports over sea routes from China and other manufacturing bases.
	At this moment, medical supplies are more related to national security than ever before.
	Should Switzerland accept this as an undeniably justified outcome of being a small country, or should Switzerland seek an extra-EU partnership to safeguard its national security from being infringed by EU friends?
	China maintains a non-alliance policy, but China always has flexibility and they will not be restricted by their own policies.
	They can say, "just some civic cargos, not military cooperation at all" when they transport face masks and protective suits to Geneva and Zurich.
	Switzerland can be more than willing to accept an offer from China as long as it does not impair the permanent neutrality policy of Switzerland when it can save Switzerland from an epidemic apocalypse caused by its good EU neighbors.
</p>
<p>
	We will see how Switzerland strengthens its ties with China after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-09/germany-faces-backlash-from-neighbors-over-mask-export-ban" target="_blank">both</a> <a href="https://www.thelocal.ch/20200312/mask-hysteria" target="_blank">incidents</a> with Deutschland.
	Guess which airliners will be most preferred by Switzerland for its logistic connections with China?
</p>

<h3>As United As China</h3>

<p>
	EU is a mess.
	Member states are issuing export bans against each other.
	The idea is simple.
	If an epidemic is contained in one place, then other places will not have to deal with it; the later the supplies are given to the quarantined area, the scarier the epidemic becomes outside.
</p>
<p>
	Ironically, what happened in China, a country many Westerns look down at, was totally the opposite.
	Other provinces offered tremendous help to Hubei; every city in Hubei got full-out medical assistance from a corresponding province.
	Thousands of medical practitioners are mobilized to assist.
	Chinese people are united.
	Chinese people are cooperative with epidemic control measures which are found infeasible, even daydreaming, in Europe.
	Now, who is the real sick man of humanity?
</p>
<p>
	Europe can only pursue and cannot achieve a common identity or a common interest unless Europe is as <strong>united</strong> as China.
	Otherwise, when dangers come, Europe will always fall apart with European countries requesting aids from China individually.
