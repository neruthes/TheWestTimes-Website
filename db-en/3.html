    With the first snow of 2020 came the first death from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When the disease was identified last December in Wuhan, a city in the center of China, the local authorities did not take it seriously. No one in China envisioned an imminent threat of an epidemic disease, let alone deaths.

    For the sake of people who love you and people who you love, please read the whole piece. Sometimes, it is not an epidemic that is life-threatening, but an ignorance of it.

<h3>Red Regime amid the Coronavirus Outbreak</h3>
<p>
    Early last December, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in China. Little did the authorities know that it was not the common cold or influenza, but a whole new disease. Later that month, several whistleblower doctors warned their colleagues and friends in online chat groups that the cases might be related to SARS, an epidemic disease that swept the globe in 2003. The authorities did not deem the warnings from the doctors acceptable, slamming them as "spreading misinformation".
</p>
<p>
    "You are hereby officially warned for posting false information on the internet. Such behavior constitutes a serious disturbance of social order and a violation of the law," a document from the police to one whistleblower declared.
</p>
<p>
    Within two weeks, "misinformation" about a SARS-related disease outbreak became widespread. Sources indicated that the disease was capable of spreading from person to person, which health authorities in Wuhan denied. The government officials downplayed the severity of the outbreak. When a Chinese New Year feast involving thousands of people was held in Wuhan, the authorities turned a blind eye to it.
</p>
<p>
    That was when Death came creeping in. On January 9, 2020, the first death in China was confirmed.

<h3>Why Chinese Collectivism Won't Work Out</h3>
<p>
    The corruption of the authorities in Wuhan is appalling to the point of unthinkability. And this is not confined to Wuhan; it is a reflection of a deep-seated problem, i.e. collectivism, all across China.
</p>
<p>
    Red China has been infamous for collectivism â€” the government indoctrinates its people to prioritize the public interest over individual rights. Therefore, some pro-China groups claim that the Communist regime enjoys tremendous advantages in terms of mobilizing people and resources for "the greater good". However, this coronavirus outbreak proved that Chinese collectivism was not the silver bullet as Communists had imagined. Quite the contrary, it is the root of all evil.
</p>
<p>
    The inaction of Wuhan authorities epitomizes what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink" target="_blank">groupthink</a>. Groupthink is a phenomenon seen within a group of people seeking harmony or cohesiveness in the group. In an attempt to avoid conflict, people in the group tend to agree with each other. In groupthink, dissenting voices are often considered harmful and independent thinking is discouraged. This is what happened and is still happening in Wuhan and throughout China. In order to keep the society "harmonious", news about the outbreak was suppressed. Those in the know were muzzled by the decision-makers in the name of "harmony".
</p>
<p>
    Groupthink is a sickness inherent in collectivism or, on a larger sense, Communism. Fortunately, the United States was born immune to it. Unlike China, our nation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address" target="_blank">conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal</a>. It is in our tradition to treat all people as our equals and embrace all voices.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Chinese collectivism is evil; it is a sin. A regime established on top of it is bound to collapse. We should expect to live to witness that day. In the meantime, we must continue to courageously uphold our Western values, including but not limited to democracy and freedom.
