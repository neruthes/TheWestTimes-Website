    The mighty WSJ has received some resentment in February for a controversial title, "China is the real sick man of Asia". This action is believed to be the trigger for a punitive measure from China's government—to expel three American journalists from Beijing. We do not know how much hatred the anonymous editor behind the masterpiece bore. However, we do know that this racist term is more dangerous than SARS-CoV-2 itself.

<h3>Editor vs Author</h3>
<p>
    Contrary to the majority repsonse, Ma Qianzu, a Suzhou-based online influencer, spoke in favor of the article and the author in his bidaily news commentary video series "Pre-Bedtime News". Ma Qianzu addressed the article, saying "the content is good and we should acknowledge this instead of ignoring the whole stuff when spotting a bad title" and praised the accuracy of the article.

    Chinese people, maybe only a few, knew that it was not the fault of the author to write such a title. In that sense, the editor played the public emotions for clicks and hotness behind a wall of anonymity and left the risk of notoriety to the author. An editor is supposed to manage things on track, but this editor has nailed everything for nothing more than his personal racist hobby.

<h3>Editor vs Employer</h3>
<p>
    In a capitalist society, an editor may not put the portfolio value of the employer at risk. This is a common truth enjoyed across all capitalist societies, including China. To mock China as an editor and to mock China as a BoD decision are two totally different matters. The job of an editor is to make money for the press, instead of making the money of the press at danger. In a society where we empahsize freedom more than anything else, a grownup adult should bear in mind that the employer has the freedom to seek business success in China and the editor should serve any pursuit within the defined responsibility as long as no law is infringed, while the editor is also free to quit. This is why we hold a superiority complex against China and the Chinese people; it is really ironic to see that the one who actively practices this racism by abusing the job capability is trying to abolish the premise for enjoying such feeling of superiority.

<h3>Management Beyond Editors</h3>
<p>
    It is more important to question the management than to accuse a clown editor.
</p>
<p>
    Not surprisingly, the top executives of WSJ has remained silent for weeks. No apology; no firing. The management team has done this before. The absence of penalty is an incentive for wrongdoings. When the interest of the shareholders is being infringed, when the objective of developing business in China is being postponed, what are the CXOs doing? The editor wore the armor of free speech, but the freedom of speech never encouraged anyone to damage the interests of its employer. The sense of humanity is already rare among the people who work in the press industry, but so is the sense of responsibility?

<h3>Real Sick Press vs National Strategy</h3>
<p>
    Racism is not only a sin, but also a betrayal of the Constitution. American ideals believe in freedom, equality, and just reward. In an era where the competition with China is more intense than ever before, we are risking losing a majority of Asian talents in our society to China. If domestic racism make Asian Americans feel discriminated, marginalized, alienated, and dehumanized, it is not hard for them to dream to Form A More Perfect Union as the Chinese nation and to find career opportunities in the Chinese society. The China-haters should hate racism more than anyone else does, otherwise eventually through their discrimination will the ultimate rise of China break their illusion of supremacy.
