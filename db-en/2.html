    When COVID-2019 still occupies the attention of almost every Chinese citizen, the upcoming immigration reform plan of China is getting popular among Chinese communities. There are also voices demanding a similar reform in the United States. On the contrary, the United States will not need a similar reform. The true might of our immigration system lies in the sources beyond the immigration law itself.
</p>

<h3>The Purpose of Immigration Sytems</h3>
<p>
    Before we examine the performance of an immigration system, we must first discuss the purpose of having any immigration system in a country. In the United States, we need an immigration system to draw investment, secure talents, and fulfill domestic demand. The pros and cons need to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
    The United States needs foreign direct investment. This is why we have EB-5. FDI creates employment. Employment makes workers occupied. Occupied workers do not become gangs or rioters. Workers with salary can afford entertaiment. This is an era where the United States needs to recruit foreign capital to improve domestic economy. Immigration is hereby made a surplus, since investment output can be less attractive to investors who only seek portfolio performance.
</p>
<p>
    The United States needs foreign talents, especially STEM talents. Domestic STEM talents may be enough for the economy to work, but not for a technological competition with China. This is why we have EB-1 and EB-2.
</p>
<p>
    Republicans and Democrats have some disagreement on the domestic demand issue. Republicans prefer to implement a stricter family reunion immigration policy. However, Democracts prioritize those who suffer family partition. Both ways represent certain portions of the voters. But surely, ICE law enforcement should be watched carefully.
</p>

<h3>What to Reform</h3>
<p>
    In the draft of the new regulation, real changes are rare. The regulation basically summarizes exisitng local practices and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Immigration_Administration">National Immigration Administration</a> policies. The American public should not be surprised by the new regulation. Neither should we feel as if China is introducing a <strong>real</strong> reform on the immigration system.
</p>

<h3>Caution Bay Area Companies</h3>
<p>
    There has been a constant complaint from Bay Area employers that they need more talents from China and India. It has been 10 years if not 20 years. Does anyone remember the dotcom bubble era? Companies rise and fall, immigrant workers stay forever.
</p>
<p>
    More Chinese computer science talents in Bay Area neither open the market of China mainland nor make US companies more competitive worldwide. Companies need more to compete with each other, but the benifit of the competition is not shared with the public. We must distinguish the need from big companies and the need from the American society. Do we need them to make big companies richer, or need them to make American society a better place, or need them to make the United States stronger? On the level of national interest, the United States does not need more computer science talents from China. More computer science talents from China will only introduce meaningless competitions among big companies, making them more competitive in exploiting domestic consumers but not in reinforcing American dominance overseas.
</p>
<p>
    However, we do need to acknowledge that there are certain cateogies of talents which we must attract; namely, STEM (excluding computer science) experts with Chinese, Russian, or Ukranian nationalities.
</p>

<h3>New Immigrants with Loyalty</h3>
<p>
    The common immigration path for international students is F-1 student visa (with 29-month OPT job-seeking period), H-1B (ordinary work visa), and EB-2 (permanent resident status). This process, from the initial arrival at the university to the final naturalization as an honorable United States citizen, takes around 20 years. 20 years is enough to make sure that the new immigrants are well accustomed to American values and cultures. We have the largest cultural crucible in the world. The American society accepts diversity, and this is a big advantage in the competition with China in terms of recruiting outstanding talents. Regardless of ethnicity, anyone may be finally accepted as a United States citizen; meanwhile, a naturalized Chinese with exotic ethnicity is permanently fresh off the boat. In this situation, one can imagine how loyal a naturalized Chinese citizen will be.
</p>

<h3>Why Immigrants Immigrate</h3>
<p>
    There are many reasons why STEM talents immigrate. In the United States, EB-2 applicants wait in queues to wait for their quota; the quota is based on the birth place of the applicant. Many people complain about this insane waiting on MITBBS and other forums, but every year there are more applicants than the quota. Applicants are still eager to obtain EB-2 even though the restrictions are heavy.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, China may not be as desirable as USA in terms of destination of immigration, at least for the people without Chinese ancestry. Real STEM talents care a lot of metrics which USA prevails at, including domestic democracy, more research funding, less bureaucracy, better working condition, better personal income, better air quality, freedom of speech, abundance of housing space, etc. Immigrants will still prefer the United States. An immigration reform in China does not make China more favorable for STEM talents seeking immigration; similarly, USA does not need an immigration reform to maintain the advantage in attracting immigrant STEM talents.
</p>

<h3>Illusions on Reforms in China</h3>
<p>
    Some people have illusions with the reforms in China, portraying the test-and-improve reforms as a model for every country to copy. However, this is simply untrue. The test-and-improve tactic, officially "touch the stones to walk through the river", is not as good as many choose to imagine. Behind the "tactic", the reality is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_People%27s_Congress">NPC</a> (the supreme parliament) refuses to take an active role in lawmaking, leaving the autonomy to the executive officers, where corruption and dereliction take place.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    The immigration system which we have now is much satisfactory for the public interest of the American society. Some minor tweaks can be good, but we should not want a reform similar to the Chinese one.
